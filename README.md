Description:

In a battle of wits between man and machine, your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills will be put to the test with a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Players must click their preferred hand sign (rock, paper, or scissors) to defeat the computer in a high stakes best-of-five challenge.

Features:

-Intuitive user interactions are made possible with click-to-play mechanics in interactive gameplay.
-Multiple rounds will ensure the ultimate winner is declared, so let's extend the fun with a Best of Five format.
-To allow for maximum immersion, the UI of minimalist design is purposely clean and devoid of any distractions.
-On any device, a seamless gaming experience is possible with the ability to adapt to various screen sizes. This is all thanks to its responsiveness.

To start playing, here are the steps you need to follow.

-Your preferred browser is where you should load the game.
-Scissors, Rock, or Paper - one of these choices must be clicked.
-Watch the computer's choice and see if you've won the round.
-Whichever comes first, the game will continue for five rounds or until a player has earned three wins.
